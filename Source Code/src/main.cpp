//screen and the velocity. With "Trails" you control if the points leave their 
//past positions on the screen or if it just draws the current position of the point

//You can change between the camera as the input or an image.You can also choose
//the image from your hard drive.With "Save presets" you save can save up to 3 presets
//of the current state of the parameters.With "Select Presets" you can change between 
//the presets.

//It also has a Spout sender to send to any program that has a spout receiver,
//such as Resolume Arena.For that you will need to install "Spout Controls", wich is included in this repository.
